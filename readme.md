# Computer Vision Course Projects

This repository contains the codes created during the Computer Vision course at UTN-FRC (National Technological University - CÃ³rdoba Regional Faculty).

## Directory Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

1. **scripts**: This directory contains the practice scripts developed during the class sessions.
2. **main-projects**: This directory contains the mandatory practical projects.

## Mandatory Practical Projects

There are two mandatory practical projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1**: The first project involves image rectification and contour measurement. It includes the following tasks:
    - Detecting and refining chessboard corners.
    - Mapping the corners to a specified destination.
    - Applying perspective transformation to rectify the image.
    - Extracting contours and measuring their dimensions in millimeters.
    
2. **Project 2**: The second project is a person detector and tracker, which is responsible for detecting people in a video stream and tracking their movements.

Both projects demonstrate fundamental techniques and concepts learned in the Computer Vision course, including image processing, transformation, and feature detection.

## How to Run

Each script and project has specific requirements and dependencies. Please refer to the individual script comments for instructions on how to run them.

These codes are intended for educational purposes and illustrate the practical applications of computer vision techniques learned in the course.
